		<p>ProjectVinyl's search function is designed to work similarly to that of Derpibooru. Searching for a single tag name returns all videos with that tag, a list of tags returns all videos that have all of those tags.</p>
		<p>You can also combine results using the OR ( | ) and AND ( & ) operators. Note that they must have spacing on either side.</p>
		<p>
			Videos additionally have support for searching them by many of their special attributes.
		</p>
		<p>
			System tags:
			<ul>
				<li>title:&lt;title&gt; - returns any videos with a matching name</li>
				<li>source:&lt;source&gt; - returns any videos with a matching source</li>
				<li>uploader:&lt;username&gt; - returns any videos posted by the named user</li>
				<li>is:audio - returns videos only if they are an audio file</li>
				<li>is:upvoted - returns videos only videos that have been liked by the current user (has no affect for anonymous users)</li>
				<li>is:downvoted - equivalent to is:upvoted but for dislikes</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<% if user_signed_in? && current_user.is_staff? %>
		<p>
			Moderation tags:
			<ul>
				<li>upvoted_by:&lt;username&gt;</li>
				<li>downvoted_by:&lt;username&gt;</li>
				<li>is:hidden</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<% end %>
		<p>
			Ranged tags:
			
			<ul>
				<li>length&lt;X - returns any videos with a length less than X where X is in the format of hh:mm:ss</li>
				<li>score&lt;X- returns any videos with a score less than X</li>
			</ul>
			
			The above tags may also be inverted by replacing the '&lt;' with a '&gt;'.
			
			eg length&gt;X - returns videos with a length <b>greater</b> than X.
		</p>
		<p>Parenthesis '(' and ')' may be used as well for additional control</p>
